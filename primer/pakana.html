        <p class="text-zinc-100 mb-4">Pakana is a core part of the node_zero universe. It powers a decentralized gig-economy, where anyone can accept Engagement Offers and complete Workorders—earning rewards for their participation. Instead of relying on a single company or authority, Pakana uses smart contracts and blockchain technology to make sure everyone plays fair and gets paid for their work.</p>
        <p class="text-zinc-100 mb-4">What makes Pakana unique is how it acts as a bridge between two major blockchains: the Stellar Foundation network and the Lamina1 network. This means that assets, payments, and proof of work can move securely between both worlds, connecting different communities and making the whole system more flexible.</p>
        <p class="text-zinc-100">In node_zero, Pakana helps keep things open and fair. It tracks who does what, locks payments until jobs are done, and makes sure that everyone can see and verify the results. So when you take on a gig or complete a task, you know your effort is recorded and rewarded—no middlemen, no hidden rules, just a transparent system built for the community.</p>
