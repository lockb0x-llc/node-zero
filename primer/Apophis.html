				There is a moment, every day, when the intensity, or data-pressure, of that ever-expanding chaotic tempest driving The Substrate falls away. <br/>
				<br/>
				When the Earthâ€™s daylight crosses the dead band stretching from Islamabad to Moscow to Belgrade to Khartoum.<br/>
				<br/>
				What's left of a place that maps labeled as The Middle East.<br/>
				<br/>
				The cacophony of data traffic fades, slightly, but perceptibly.<br/>
				No satellite hovers there. No packets can be routed directly through.<br/>
				Each day, as the sun passed over the scorched dead band, the Substrate registered a silence so complete 
				that even the bots hesitated to and re-calculated their checks-sums. <br/>
				The rest of the planet, cast in shadow, slumbered. <br/>
				
				<span class="block text-cyber-magenta mt-6">
					This disturbance was just enough to trigger much of the substrate's layers to automatically back-up, reboot, and reknit itself with a new layer of content, patches, and stored value in its many forms, adding a new layer of metadata to an ever-expanding digital tapestry. <br/>
                    <br/>
                    This creates a momentary cascading storm of data and network traffic that ripples across The Substrate like a digital tsunami.
                </span>

				This was the aftermath of April 13, 2029, when the Apophis asteroid made its closest approach to Earth, passing within 19,400 miles of the surface. <br/>
				<br/>

				A pair of craters, surrounded by rings of newly formed mountains, heaved upward from the bedrock by the impacts of the two, relatively small trailing fragments of the asteroid, at first unnoticed, undetected, unexpected. Until it was too late to deploy any kind of counter-measure. <br/>
				<br/>
				Ripples of black obsidian shards, hundreds of feet in height, radiated from the scorched and vitrified impact-zones where the two massive asteroid fragments struck.<br/>
				<br/>
				A live video stream from the AmaStar orbital mining depot is burned into the memory of those who watched that unholy apocalypse unfold on their devices. <br/>
				Then, somehow, they survived the aftermath, rebuilt, and carried on.<br/>
				<br/>
				As living things and other sentient beings tend to do.<br/>
				<br/>
				The Earth continues to spin; the sun's rays soon cast on more habitable latitudes, and the Substrate's hum resumes apace, like a new day.
