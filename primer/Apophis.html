					There is a moment, every cycle, when the quantum storm of the substrate thins.<br/>
					Now, in 2149, daylight sweeps across the dead band: a scar from Islamabad to Moscow, Belgrade to Khartoum.<br/>
					The old maps called it the Middle East. Now, it is a silent tear in the layers of the mesh, 
					like a data black hole, place where the substrate’s hum falters.<br/>
					No satellite hovers here; the quantum mesh reroutes, leaving only a digital shadow.<br/>
					Each day, as the sun passes over the scorched silence, even the bots hesitate, recalculating their checksums.<br/>
					The rest of the world pulses with data, but here, the mesh holds its breath.<br/>
					<br/>
					When the anomaly hits, this dip in traffic, this unexpected quiet gap in the routing tables and energy supply, the substrate’s automated layers react on instinct. Defensive protocols trigger. Ledgers, nodes, and agents back up, reboot, respawn. The mesh braces, uncertain if the silence is a threat or a glitch, and every system prepares to survive the unknown.<br/>

					This disturbance was just enough to trigger much of the substrate's layers to automatically back-up, reboot, and reknit itself with a new layer of content, patches, and stored value in its many forms, adding a new layer of metadata to an ever-expanding digital tapestry. <br/>
                    <br/>
                    This creates a momentary cascading storm of data and network traffic that ripples across The Substrate like a digital tsunami.

				This was the aftermath of April 13, 2029, when the Apophis asteroid made its closest approach to Earth, passing within 19,400 miles of the surface. <br/>

				A pair of craters, surrounded by rings of newly formed mountains, heaved upward from the bedrock by the impacts of the two, relatively small trailing fragments of the asteroid, at first unnoticed, undetected, unexpected. Until it was too late to deploy any kind of counter-measure. <br/>
				<br/>
				Ripples of black obsidian shards, hundreds of feet in height, radiated from the scorched and vitrified impact-zones where the two massive asteroid fragments struck.<br/>
				<br/>
				A live video stream from the AmaStar orbital mining depot is burned into the memory of those who watched that unholy apocalypse unfold on their devices. <br/>
				Then, somehow, they survived the aftermath, rebuilt, and carried on.<br/>
				<br/>
				As living things and other sentient beings tend to do.<br/>
				<br/>
				The Earth continues to spin; the sun's rays soon cast on more habitable latitudes, and the Substrate's hum resumes apace, like a new day.
