        Betanet — Promise and Play (2023)
      </h1>

      <!-- The Carnival Opens (default font) -->
      <section class="mb-12">
        <h2 class="text-2xl neon-cyan mb-4">The Carnival Opens</h2>
        <p class="mb-4 text-white">
          Betanet arrived like a digital carnival. The Discord swelled to tens of thousands,
          its channels buzzing with quest prompts, badge claims, and countdowns. The pitch
          was simple: complete tasks, earn XP, climb the leaderboard. For the first time,
          participation felt like gameplay — not just chatter.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-white">
          For creators, it was proof that Lamina1 could generate momentum. For speculators,
          it was a way to farm digital clout before tokens existed. For everyone else, it
          was a spectacle — noisy, chaotic, alive.
        </p>
      </section>

      <div class="share-tech-mono">
        <!-- The First Spaces -->
        <section class="mb-12">
          <h2 class="text-2xl neon-magenta mb-4">The First Spaces</h2>
          <p class="mb-4 text-white">
            Then came the demos. <em>Space Lasers</em> — a neon browser shooter where you
            could mint a “Custom Laser” NFT and fire it across the screen.
            <em>Nyric</em> — a downloadable prototype showing how authentication might work
            between Spaces. For the first time, Lamina1 users could log in through the Hub,
            carry items with them, and watch blockchain assets stitched into live gameplay.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4 text-white">
            It wasn’t polished. It wasn’t even stable. But it was real. And that was enough.
            For a moment, Betanet turned speculation into play — proof, however glitchy,
            that the architecture could hold more than white papers and Discord threads.
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- The Glow and the Glitch -->
        <section class="mb-12">
          <h2 class="text-2xl neon-green mb-4">The Glow and the Glitch</h2>
          <p class="mb-4 text-white">
            On the surface, it worked. Quests completed, badges minted, screenshots posted
            like trophies. The carnival lights dazzled, and the numbers soared.
            Fifty thousand participants, the headlines said.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4 text-white">
            But in the margins, something flickered. Quests completed at machine speed.
            New accounts spawning faster than moderators could welcome them. Wallets with
            nothing but XP and a trail of identical behavior. Some said it was just rapid
            growth. Others whispered about scripts grinding through the system.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4 animate-pulse-slow text-white">
            Nobody wanted to look too closely. Not yet.
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- The Uneasy Promise -->
        <section class="mb-12">
          <h2 class="text-2xl neon-yellow mb-4">The Uneasy Promise</h2>
          <p class="mb-4 text-white">
            Betanet dazzled like a midway at night — loud, bright, and impossible to ignore.
            The demos inspired, the quests gamified the crowd, and on paper the promise was intact.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4 text-white">
            But beneath the glow, the cracks were widening. Wallets with nothing but XP.
            Accounts completing quests faster than any human could. Growth without people.
            For the moment, the illusion held, and few wanted to look too closely.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4 text-white">
            Mainnet would change that. The lights would come up, and whatever shadows had gathered in Betanet
            would be impossible to ignore.
