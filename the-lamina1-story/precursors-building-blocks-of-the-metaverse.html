    <div id="chapter-content" class="chapter-content text-lg leading-relaxed flex flex-col">
            <h2 class="text-2xl neon-magenta mb-4">Cypherpunks in the Dial-Up Era</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">Most people in the 1990s were still logging into walled gardens: AOL, CompuServe, Prodigy. Pre-packaged internet with parental controls and a price tag. The <em>real</em> internet, the open one, felt raw, unfinished, and a little dangerous.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Inside that chaos, the cypherpunks were busy. Mailing lists full of pseudonyms and manifestos, trading source code like contraband. Their creed: privacy was not a luxury, it was survival. Public-key cryptography, digital cash, anonymous remailers, all were sketching blueprints for a future nobody else believed would come.</p>
            <p class="mb-8">To outsiders, it all looked like paranoia. To insiders, it was the only way to live free in a coming world of surveillance. They weren’t building a metaverse yet, they were building armor.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl neon-cyan mb-4">Satoshi’s Eight Pages</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">Fast forward to 2008. The global economy was in flames, Wall Street getting bailouts while everyone else got foreclosures. And then, on an obscure cryptography list, a ghost posted a white paper: <em>“Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.”</em> It was eight pages long.</p>
            <p class="mb-8">It didn’t look like prophecy, but it was. A monetary system with no bankers, no kings, and no permission slips, just consensus written in code. Suddenly, digital scarcity was real, and trust didn’t have to flow through governments or corporations. It could flow through math.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl neon-green mb-4">Ethereum: Code as Law</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">But Bitcoin was a ledger, dumb money that only knew how to move from A to B. In 2015, Ethereum cracked that open. It made money programmable. “Smart contracts,” they called them, though they were closer to vending machines than lawyers.</p>
            <p class="mb-8">Still, it changed everything. DAOs emerged, networks that could govern themselves in theory. NFTs, tokens that turned JPEGs into property deeds. The whole thing was messy, expensive, and often ridiculous. But for a moment, it felt like maybe, just maybe, the network could run itself.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl neon-yellow mb-4">Avalanche, Meta, and the Mirage of VR</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">By the 2020s, more contenders arrived. Avalanche promised speed, consensus without waiting, cheap transactions, the kind of throughput a game world would need. It wasn’t the first blockchain to claim scale, but it was one of the first that actually worked.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Meanwhile, Meta, Zuckerberg’s empire, tried to brute-force its way into Stephenson’s playbook. Headsets, billions in burn, cartoon avatars grinning in a corporate-branded wasteland. It was supposed to be the metaverse, but it looked more like a marketing department trapped inside <em>The Sims</em>.</p>
            <p class="mb-8">And yet, hardware got better. Headsets shrank. AR prototypes slipped into the edges of everyday life. Even Magic Leap, where Stephenson himself had once dabbled, proved that fiction could shape R&amp;D.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl neon-cyan mb-4">The Pattern Emerging</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">Each step had flaws. Cypherpunks fought over implementation. Bitcoin ossified into digital gold. Ethereum drowned in its own gas fees. Meta turned satire into a product demo.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">But taken together, they were more than failures. They were scaffolding. Pieces of a half-built structure, waiting for someone to claim they could finish it.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">That’s the stage Lamina1 walked onto: declaring itself “The Layer 1 for the Open Metaverse,” backed by the man who coined the very word.</p>
