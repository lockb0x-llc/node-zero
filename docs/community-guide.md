**Central Inquiry Handbook**  
This document explains how present-day participants engage with the archive.  
Your role is to **create quantum causalities** â€” contributions anchored in both GitHub and Lamina1.

---

## The Participation Loop

1. **Fork the Archive (GitHub)**

   - Create your own fork of the `node_zero` repository.
   - Add a story, dossier, or artifact as Markdown (`/community/md/`) or HTML (`/community/web/`).

2. **Mint the Anchor (Lamina1)**

   - Create an NFT on your **Lamina1 Hub profile**.
   - In the NFT metadata, include the same **reference code** you placed in your file.
   - This dual presence entangles your contribution.

3. **Submit to the Inquiry (Pull Request)**

   - Open a Pull Request with your new fragment.
   - Include your **reference code** so the archive can verify entanglement.

4. **Merge and Preserve**

   - Once accepted, your contribution is merged into the canonical archive.
   - Your NFT becomes the **causal anchor** on Lamina1.
   - The fragment is now preserved both on-chain and in the substrate.

5. **Receive Attribution + Bounty**
   - Your chosen alias is inscribed in the archive.
   - You receive an **NFT bounty** as proof of authorship and existence.
