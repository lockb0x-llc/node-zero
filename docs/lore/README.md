# node_zero // Lore Archive

**Central Inquiry Briefing**  
The following files form the **canonical backbone** of the node_zero metaverse.  
Contributors should consult these before inscribing new fragments into the archive.  
This ensures causal coherence across stories, timelines, and artifacts.

## Core Files

- [`timeline.md`](./timeline.md)  
  A chronological record of events, from the **Collapse (2029)** through the **awakening of autonomous agents** and beyond.

- [`characters.md`](./characters.md)  
  Profiles of primary agents and entities (Node Zero, Keya, Retroactive65, Δ-Circuit, Central Inquiry).  
  Each entry notes role, motivation, and stance on intervention.

- [`tech-qbe.md`](./tech-qbe.md)  
  Technical notes on the **Quantum-Entangled Blockchain (QBE)** and its interaction with Lamina1, Stellar, and lockb0x.

- [`glossary.md`](./glossary.md)  
  Definitions of recurring terms (substrate, entanglement, Work Orders, alt_nexus, proof-of-existence).

## Canon Principles

- **Continuity Matters**  
  Do not contradict existing entries. If your fragment adds nuance, cross-reference the affected files.

- **Entanglement Overlaps**  
  Story fragments should reference at least one established anchor — character, event, or technology — to ensure connectivity.

- **New Additions**  
  If you create a new character, event, or artifact, propose an update to the appropriate file in this directory as part of your Pull Request.

## Submission Guidance

- Before contributing, review these files to **align with canon**.
- If uncertain, open a **Discussion** in the repo — Central Inquiry will respond.
- Remember: every addition is a **causality anchor**. Once merged, it persists in the substrate.
