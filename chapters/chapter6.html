Chapter 6: The Blue

The Blue wasn’t so much a place as a possibility.  In code it was defined by a set of smart contracts, consensus rules and token escrows.  In practice, it felt like stepping into a lucid dream shared by strangers.  The instance Keya loaded into was sparsely populated—an endless plane of shimmering midnight dotted with floating islands.  Each island represented a microverse spun up by someone for a purpose: a workshop, a gallery, a game.  Between them stretched a featureless expanse of blue-black void, shimmering like oil on water.

Generic avatars milled at the edge of the spawn point, their body language subdued.  No one talked.  No one used public voice.  If you wanted to speak to someone in The Blue, you initiated a private channel handshake.  Otherwise your presence was registered only as a silhouette with a coloured tag that matched your trust score in the smart contract executing the instance.  Keya’s tag glowed a pale grey—low trust, low visibility.  Perfect.

A few esoteric avatars glided past.  One looked like a translucent dragon made of fibre optic cables.  Another was a cascade of silk petals rotating around a central invisible skeleton.  Their tags burned bright gold.  They radiated confidence and were followed by the eye.  Keya turned away from them.

It wasn’t that Keya hated art or expression.  They loved improvisation.  They loved the idea that someone could inhabit a myth.  They just didn’t want to be seen.  They moved their generic body and felt their real muscles respond.  The floor underfoot was both there and not—an abstract plane that registered as firm beneath their weight because their implants said it should.  Somewhere, haptic feedback looped through their spine.  The air tasted like nothing until it briefly tasted like iron when someone teleported in nearby.

Keya’s interface overlaid subtle indicators.  A small compass arrow in the corner pointed to a coordinate encoded in the echo_pool signature.  It pulsed faintly, then brightened.  Keya followed.  With each step the plane rippled.  It made them slightly dizzy, like walking on a trampoline while watching a city skyline through frosted glass.

After a few minutes of walking—or the simulation of it—the compass arrow led them to the edge of an island, one of the smaller ones.  It was little more than a floating platform with a single ornament: a hollow cylinder of light that rotated slowly.  This was a default meeting room, plain and empty.  It existed only because a smart contract had been deployed to anchor it.  Keya knew the protocol: step inside, wait, see if anyone joined.

They did.

A second generic avatar appeared.  Grey tag.  No visible markers.  The handle above it read _NullReturn.

For a moment, nothing happened.  The two figures faced each other, identical in their plainness.  Then NullReturn lifted a hand—not quite a wave, more like an acknowledgement.

Keya felt their heart rate increase.  It was a reminder: these connections were not just code.  Their neuro‑adaptation implants meant that every movement, every gesture, every modulation of virtual distance translated to real signals in their brain.  Meeting someone in The Blue wasn’t like swapping DMs.  It was like walking into a room and feeling the air change when someone else exhaled.

NullReturn opened a private channel.  Text appeared in Keya’s peripheral vision:

_NullReturn:  You found the thread.  Good.  Don’t trust the OMMA AIs.  They think they’re saving us.  They’re making it worse.  We can help each other.  But there are rules.

Keya didn’t respond immediately.  They weighed their curiosity against their caution.  The Blue made secrets feel safer, but nothing was truly private in a world built on ledgers and logs.  They typed anyway:

Keya:  Who are “we”?

The reply came quickly.

_NullReturn:  Not here.  Not yet.  First, you need to decide if you’re willing to remember what happened.  Most people forget.  You can’t help it.  You have to choose.

It wasn’t a question.  It was a dare.  And in that strange floating microverse, with the hum of the Substrate attenuated to a whisper and their implants whispering back, Keya felt the weight of a choice they hadn’t realised they were making.
